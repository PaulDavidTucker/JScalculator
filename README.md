# JScalculator
A simple JS calculator with a  CSS + HTML frontend. I hope to use this project as a way to practice writing clean, resuable code. 

Additionally, I hope to practice my styling skills, as well as implementing functionality into my website.

This is what the main interface looks like:

![MainTitleScreen](/img/MainInterface.png)

Buttons can add input:

![Input](/img/Input.png)

To run use the VS code "Live server" extension to see in browser, I haven't learnt how to host/ set up an environment with NPM and nodeJS, or ruby etc.
