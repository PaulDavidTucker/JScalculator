# JScalculator
A simple JS calculator with a  CSS + HTML frontend. I hope to use this project as a way to practice writing clean, resuable code. 

Additionally, I hope to practice my styling skills, as well as implementing functionality into my website.

This is what the main interface looks like:

Buttons can add input:

Localhost Installation:

1. Ensure your NPM and Node.js versions are >=9 and >=14 respectively.

2. Run:

```sh
npm install
```
This will generate a node_modules folder for your project. Note on Linux systems, it may be necessary to preface these commands with "sudo" to allow npm to access the /npm install location on your machine.

3. Run:

```sh
npm run tryInstall
```

This installs the live-server package (in case it has not been included as a dependancy).

4. Start the server with:

```sh
npm start
```
This will generate a live server instance and begin running in your browser. Custom ports and entry for the server can be set in package.json , under the 'npm start' command. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server for all options available.

Any contributions to this are welcome! Create a branch, and improve my terrible project!
